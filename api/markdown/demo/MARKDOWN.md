# Markdown API

Yes, this is the better version of the Markdown API from Github. You don't have to do any kind of Javascript. (Also it is supposed to look like Markdown You'd see on Github.)

## Usage

Just embed the file like:

```html
<iframe width="767" src="https://hotdoguy90.github.io/api/markdown/?markdown=URL_FOR_MD_FILE"></iframe>
```

After all, that is what this HTML demo is doing.
